- Improved update_last_failing_files logic: now clears last-failing-playwright-files.txt if there are no 'âœ˜' (failures) in Playwright output, regardless of 'All tests pass' message.
- Ensures rerun infra and reporting are always in sync with actual test results.
- Fixes issue where stale failures could persist after a fully passing run.
- All changes committed as WIP for further review.
