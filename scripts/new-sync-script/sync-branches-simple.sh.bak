# SYNC SCRIPT FLOW OVERVIEW
# =====================================================================

# 1. Drag-and-Drop Support
#    - Detect if script is invoked via drag-and-drop (quoted path).
#    - Re-execute itself with correct path/arguments if needed.

# 2. Pre-Sync Checks & Setup
#    - Ensure script is run inside a git repository.
#    - Parse command-line arguments:
#        --dry-run         Show what would happen without making changes.
#        --auto-commit     Automatically commit unstaged changes before syncing.
#        --debug           Show detailed logs for troubleshooting.
#        --no-verify       Skip pre-commit and pre-push git hooks (note: this is not the same as --no-tests; --no-verify skips all git hooks, while --no-tests only skips running tests).
#        --no-lint         Skip linting and formatting checks.
#        --no-tests        Skip running tests before syncing.
#        --config <file>   Use a custom config file for default/toggleable options.
#        --branch <name>   Use a specific branch as source/target for syncing.
#        ...add others as needed for your workflow.
#    - Check for clean working directory (or handle with auto-commit/stash if enabled).
#    - Load config file if present (toggleable default options).

# 3. Pre-commit Linting/Formatting (toggleable)
#    - Optionally run lint (e.g., npm run lint) and/or formatting checks before auto-commit or sync.
#    - Check for TypeScript errors (e.g., npx tsc --noEmit) and abort or warn if any are found.
#    - Check for ESLint errors (e.g., npx eslint .) and abort or warn if any are found.
#    - Abort or warn if there are lint errors.
#    - Ask if the user wants to automatically fix lint errors (e.g., run npm run lint -- --fix or similar).
#    - If user agrees, attempt to fix and re-check; otherwise, abort or continue based on user choice.

# 4. Pre-push Hook Simulation (toggleable)
#    - Optionally run any scripts you have in .husky/pre-push or similar, to catch issues before pushing.

# 5. Backup/Restore (sync_tmp_backups/)
#    - Before major syncs/merges, back up the working directory or branch to sync_tmp_backups/.
#    - Only keep the most recent necessary backups, delete old ones to save space.
#    - Allow easy restore if needed.

# 6. Interactive Branch Selection
#    - List all local branches, ordered by most recent commit.
#    - Number each branch for selection.
#    - Highlight the current branch:
#        * Green asterisk (*) if working directory is clean.
#        * Yellow asterisk (*) if there are unstaged/uncommitted changes.
#    - Prompt user to select one or more branches by number (e.g., 1 3 5).
#    - Option to create a new branch by entering "+".
#    - Validate input and map numbers to branch names.

# 7. Auto-commit Flow (if enabled)
#    - Detect if there are any unstaged or uncommitted changes in the working directory.
#    - If changes are present:
#        - Prompt the user for a detailed commit message (provide a sensible default, e.g., "Auto-commit before sync").
#        - Optionally show a diff summary (e.g., git diff --stat) to help the user write a meaningful message.
#        - Ask the user if they want to modify or edit the commit message before finalizing.
#        - Stage all changes (including new, modified, and deleted files).
#        - Commit the changes with the provided message.
#        - Confirm to the user that the auto-commit was made.
#    - If no changes are present:
#        - Inform the user that the working directory is clean and skip the auto-commit step.

# 8. Run Jest/Playwright/Other Tests (toggleable)
#    - Run Jest, Playwright, or other tests on the current branch after auto-commit (if enabled).
#    - If tests pass:
#        - Proceed to branch selection and sync/merge.
#    - If tests fail:
#        - Abort the sync, inform the user, and allow them to fix issues before continuing.

# 9. Stash Flow (if enabled)
#    - If you do NOT want to commit your current changes but still want to sync:
#        - Stash any uncommitted changes before syncing (temporarily save and hide them).
#        - Perform the sync/merge operations on the committed state only.
#        - After syncing is complete, restore the stashed changes to your working directory.
#    - This allows you to sync branches without including your current uncommitted work.

# 10. Sync/Merge Flow (toggleable parallel)
#    - For each selected target branch (in parallel if enabled):
#        - Checkout target branch.
#        - Merge current branch into target.
#        - Handle merge conflicts interactively (offer to open conflicted files in editor).
#        - Prompt for/edit commit message if needed (show diff summary and allow editing).
#        - Push to remote.
#        - Log/report success or failure.

# 11. Sync/Push Summary Table
#    - After all syncs, print a summary table showing which branches were updated, pushed, or had errors.

# 12. Post-Sync Actions
#    - Return to original branch.
#    - Show post-sync diff summary (e.g., git diff --stat).
#    - Cleanup any temporary state.

# 13. Open GitHub Page After Upload
#    - After a successful push to remote, automatically open the corresponding GitHub page for the branch in the default browser.
#    - Inform the user that the page is being opened.

# 14. Branch Cleanup (Optional)
#    - After syncing, provide an option to delete unneeded branches.
#        - Allow deletion of local branches.
#        - Allow deletion of remote branches (with confirmation).
#    - Confirm branch deletion actions with the user before proceeding.

# 15. Error Handling & Logging
#    - Log all major actions and errors.
#    - Abort on critical errors, continue with others if possible.
#    - Provide clear user feedback at each step.

# ADVANCED FEATURES
# =====================================================================
# - All features above should be implemented as toggleable where noted.
# - Backup files should be managed in sync_tmp_backups/ as described.
# - Config file support for default/toggleable options.
# - Verbose/debug mode for troubleshooting.
# - Dry run enhancements for previewing all actions.
