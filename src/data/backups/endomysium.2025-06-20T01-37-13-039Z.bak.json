    "short_explanation": "The endomysium wraps each muscle fiber and offers support and nutrient exchange.",

    "question": "Which layer of connective tissue directly surrounds an individual muscle fiber?",
    "short_explanation": "The endomysium encloses each muscle fiber individually.",
    "long_explanation": "Skeletal muscle tissue is organized into fibers, fascicles, and whole muscles. The endomysium surrounds each muscle fiber, while the perimysium groups fibers into fascicles, and the epimysium surrounds the entire muscle.",
    "clinical_application": "Accurate palpation techniques target layers like the endomysium, especially in detailed fiber-level release work.",
