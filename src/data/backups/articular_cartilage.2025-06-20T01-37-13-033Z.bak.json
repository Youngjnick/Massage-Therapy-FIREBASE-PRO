    "short_explanation": "Articular cartilage cushions the ends of bones at synovial joints and reduces friction.",
    "long_explanation": "Articular cartilage, made of hyaline cartilage, covers the epiphyses of long bones where joints form. Its smooth surface helps reduce friction and absorb shock during movement.",
    "clinical_application": "Massage therapy can help maintain joint health indirectly by improving circulation and reducing surrounding muscle tension, especially when cartilage degeneration is present.",
