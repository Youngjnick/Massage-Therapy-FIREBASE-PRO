    "question": "What is the primary function of articular cartilage?",
    "short_explanation": "Articular cartilage cushions the ends of bones at synovial joints and reduces friction.",
    "long_explanation": "Articular cartilage, made of hyaline cartilage, covers the epiphyses of long bones where joints form. Its smooth surface helps reduce friction and absorb shock during movement.",
    "clinical_application": "Massage therapy can help maintain joint health indirectly by improving circulation and reducing surrounding muscle tension, especially when cartilage degeneration is present.",

    "question": "Which type of cartilage forms articular cartilage?",
    "short_explanation": "Articular cartilage is composed of smooth, glossy hyaline cartilage.",
    "long_explanation": "Hyaline cartilage provides a low-friction, load-bearing surface in joints. It lacks a perichondrium and is avascular, making it slow to heal when damaged.",
    "clinical_application": "Understanding cartilage type helps massage therapists consider the limitations of regeneration in chronic joint conditions like osteoarthritis.",
