    "short_explanation": "Articular cartilage cushions the ends of bones at synovial joints and reduces friction.",
    "long_explanation": "Articular cartilage, made of hyaline cartilage, covers the epiphyses of long bones where joints form. Its smooth surface helps reduce friction and absorb shock during movement.",

    "short_explanation": "Articular cartilage is composed of smooth, glossy hyaline cartilage.",
    "long_explanation": "Hyaline cartilage provides a low-friction, load-bearing surface in joints. It lacks a perichondrium and is avascular, making it slow to heal when damaged.",

    "short_explanation": "Articular cartilage is avascular and aneural, which limits its healing capacity.",
