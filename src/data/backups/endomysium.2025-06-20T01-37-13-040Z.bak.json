    "short_explanation": "The endomysium wraps each muscle fiber and offers support and nutrient exchange.",
    "long_explanation": "The endomysium is a thin layer of connective tissue that surrounds each individual muscle fiber. It supports capillaries and nerve fibers and helps maintain alignment and integrity during muscle contraction.",

    "short_explanation": "The endomysium encloses each muscle fiber individually.",
    "long_explanation": "Skeletal muscle tissue is organized into fibers, fascicles, and whole muscles. The endomysium surrounds each muscle fiber, while the perimysium groups fibers into fascicles, and the epimysium surrounds the entire muscle.",

    "short_explanation": "The endomysium contains collagen and elastin to provide strength and elasticity.",
