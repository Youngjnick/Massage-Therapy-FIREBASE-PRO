      "It only uses the elbows for pressure",
      "It focuses on superficial skin-fascial pulls rather than deep muscle work",
      "It uses oil for better glide",

    "short_explanation": "CTM focuses on superficial skin-fascial pulls, unlike deep tissue massage which targets muscles.",
    "long_explanation": "CTM distinguishes itself from deep tissue massage by working primarily on the skin and subcutaneous fascia, using traction techniques to stimulate reflex arcs. It does not aim to release muscle knots or use compressive force, but instead accesses autonomic pathways through the skin.",
