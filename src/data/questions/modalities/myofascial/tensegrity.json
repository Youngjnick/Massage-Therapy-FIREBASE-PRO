    "long_explanation": "Tensegrity (tensional integrity) is a biomechanical model where structural integrity is maintained by a continuous tension network (fascia, muscles, ligaments) and discontinuous compression elements (bones). In the human body, this means posture and movement depend on the dynamic interplay between soft tissues and the skeletal frame, not just bone stacking.",
