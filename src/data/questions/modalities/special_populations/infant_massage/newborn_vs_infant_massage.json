      "Newborns prefer deep tissue pressure, while infants do not.",

      "Infants should not receive massage under any circumstances.",
      "Newborns respond better to sports massage than infants."
    ],
    "correct": "Newborns require shorter, gentler sessions due to immature nervous systems.",
    "short_explanation": "Newborns have underdeveloped nervous systems and tolerate only very light, brief touch.",
    "long_explanation": "Massage for newborns must be approached with great sensitivity due to their immature nervous and circulatory systems. Sessions should be brief, lasting only a few minutes, and use feather-light strokes. Infants (1 month and older) can gradually tolerate longer sessions and slightly firmer pressure as their sensory systems develop.",

    "short_explanation": "Effleurage is a gentle stroking technique suitable for newborns.",

    "short_explanation": "Around 4–6 weeks, infants begin to tolerate longer massages.",

    "short_explanation": "Newborn digestion is sensitive, and pressure can trigger spit-up.",
    "long_explanation": "After feeding, the lower esophageal sphincter in newborns is immature, and abdominal massage can lead to regurgitation. Waiting 30+ minutes allows digestion to begin and reduces this risk.",
