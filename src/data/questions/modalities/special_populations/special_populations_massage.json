    "long_explanation": "Older adults often present with age-related changes such as thinner skin, reduced elasticity, poor circulation, and use of medications like anticoagulants. Therapists must assess these factors before applying techniques. Gentle Swedish massage, passive range-of-motion, and attention to comfort and communication are typically recommended.",
    "applied_example": "An 80-year-old client on blood thinners is scheduled for massage. The therapist avoids deep pressure and instead uses light effleurage to promote relaxation without risking bruising.",
