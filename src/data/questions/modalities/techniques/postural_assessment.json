    "short_explanation": "Kyphotic-lordotic posture involves excessive spinal curves with forward head and rounded shoulders.",
    "long_explanation": "Kyphotic-lordotic posture is characterized by an exaggerated thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis. This pattern typically presents with a forward head, rounded shoulders, and an anterior pelvic tilt. It often results from prolonged sitting, poor ergonomics, or muscle imbalances.",
    "clinical_application": "Massage therapy can help address postural distortions by releasing tight muscles such as the pectorals and upper trapezius, while supporting awareness and balance of spinal curves.",
