    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "distractors": [1, 2, 3],
    "short_explanation": "Dual innervation means both autonomic divisions innervate the same organ.",
    "long_explanation": "Dual innervation occurs when an organ is controlled by both sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, allowing for more refined control of function. For example, the heart receives excitatory input from the sympathetic system and inhibitory input from the parasympathetic system.",
    "applied_example": "Massage therapy aiming to modulate autonomic tone may influence both divisions and impact dual-innervated organs like the heart and digestive tract.",
