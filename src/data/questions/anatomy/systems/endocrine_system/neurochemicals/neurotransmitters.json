    "correct": 2,
    "distractors": [],
    "short_explanation": "Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that initiates muscle contraction. It transmits signals from motor neurons to muscle fibers.",
    "long_explanation": "Acetylcholine is released at neuromuscular junctions, where it binds to receptors on skeletal muscle cells, triggering an action potential and resulting in contraction. This process is fundamental to voluntary movement and motor control. Dysfunction in acetylcholine signaling can result in paralysis or muscle fatigue, as seen in conditions like myasthenia gravis.",

    "long_explanation": "Serotonin (5-HT) is found in the brain and gastrointestinal tract. It influences mood, appetite, circadian rhythm, and even social behavior. Low serotonin levels are associated with depression and anxiety, while higher levels support feelings of well-being. Many antidepressants work by increasing serotonin levels in the brain.",
