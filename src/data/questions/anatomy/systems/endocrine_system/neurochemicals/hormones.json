    "long_explanation": "Thyroxine (T4) is a thyroid hormone responsible for regulating basal metabolic rate, energy production, and oxygen consumption throughout the body. It is secreted by the thyroid gland in response to TSH from the pituitary and helps maintain healthy growth, temperature, and weight balance. Hypothyroidism leads to fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance, while hyperthyroidism may cause anxiety, heat sensitivity, and weight loss.",
    "clinical_application": "A massage therapist working with a client who has hypothyroidism may focus on increasing circulation and muscle pliability, since clients may present with fatigue, sluggish tissue, or cold extremities.",

It's released as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Chronic elevation due to prolonged stress can lead to fatigue, muscle breakdown, weight gain, and anxiety.",

    "long_explanation": "Epinephrine is a fast-acting hormone released from the adrenal medulla in response to acute stress. It prepares the body for immediate action by dilating airways, increasing heart rate, and mobilizing energy stores. Its rapid effects contrast with cortisol's longer-term stress response.",
