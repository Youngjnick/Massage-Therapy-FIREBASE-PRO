    "short_explanation": "The Gate Control Theory suggests that non-painful input can block or reduce the perception of pain signals at the spinal cord level.",
    "long_explanation": "The Gate Control Theory, developed by Melzack and Wall in the 1960s, proposes that pain is not a direct result of activation of pain receptors, but rather it is modulated by a gating mechanism in the spinal cord. Non-painful stimuli, like pressure or touch, can activate larger nerve fibers (A-beta), which in turn inhibit pain transmission from smaller pain fibers (A-delta and C fibers). This theory helps explain why rubbing an area after injury can decrease discomfort.",

    "unit": "gate control theory",
    "short_explanation": "More pain signals reach the brain, increasing pain perception.",
    "long_explanation": "When the gate is 'open', inhibitory control at the spinal cord is reduced, allowing pain signals from A-delta and C fibers to ascend to the brain without suppression. This leads to heightened pain perception. Stress, anxiety, or lack of sensory input can contribute to the gate staying open.",

      "Pain perception decreases",

    "unit": "gate control theory",
    "short_explanation": "Stimulating sensory nerves can inhibit or reduce pain signal transmission.",
    "long_explanation": "Gate Control Theory shows that non-painful stimuli can modulate pain by activating sensory pathways that suppress pain transmission at the spinal cord. This interaction between sensory input and pain modulation is foundational to why massage therapy, physical touch, or even heat and cold can reduce perceived pain intensity.",
