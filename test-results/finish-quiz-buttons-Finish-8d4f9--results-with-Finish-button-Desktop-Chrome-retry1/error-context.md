More Info: This muscle originates from the thoracolumbar fascia, iliac crest, and lateral half of the inguinal ligament. It contributes to trunk rotation and compression of abdominal contents. Clinical Application: In cases of lateral strain or scoliosis, internal oblique involvement may be targeted in therapy."

      - text: "Your answer: Intercostal nerves (T7–T11) and subcostal nerve (T12) Correct answer: Intercostal nerves (T7–T11) and subcostal nerve (T12) Explanation: The rectus abdominis is innervated by lower thoracic spinal nerves. More Info: Specifically, the intercostal nerves from T7 to T11 and the subcostal nerve (T12) innervate the rectus abdominis, allowing voluntary motor control during trunk flexion and compression of abdominal contents. Clinical Application: This is relevant when assessing abdominal wall weakness or post-surgical nerve impairment."
