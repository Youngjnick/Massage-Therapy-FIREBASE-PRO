More Info: The Gate Control Theory, developed by Melzack and Wall in the 1960s, proposes that pain is not a direct result of activation of pain receptors, but rather it is modulated by a gating mechanism in the spinal cord. Non-painful stimuli, like pressure or touch, can activate larger nerve fibers (A-beta), which in turn inhibit pain transmission from smaller pain fibers (A-delta and C fibers). This theory helps explain why rubbing an area after injury can decrease discomfort.
