  - listitem:
    - strong: Which structure provides sensory input to the amygdala to help assess threats?
    - text: "Your answer: Cerebellum Correct answer: Thalamus Explanation: The thalamus routes sensory information to the amygdala. More Info: The thalamus acts as a sensory relay center, delivering visual, auditory, and somatic signals directly to the amygdala for rapid emotional processing."
  - listitem:
    - strong: Which emotion is most directly associated with the amygdala?
    - text: "Your answer: No answer Correct answer: Fear Explanation: Fear is primarily processed by the amygdala. More Info: Neuroimaging studies show heightened amygdala activity during fear-based stimuli. It also stores fear-based emotional memories."
  - listitem:
    - strong: Which structure does the amygdala communicate with to activate the stress response?
    - text: "Your answer: No answer Correct answer: Hypothalamus Explanation: The amygdala activates the hypothalamus to initiate the HPA axis. More Info: Through its connections to the hypothalamus, the amygdala activates the HPA axis, triggering cortisol release in response to fear."
  - listitem:
    - strong: How does the amygdala influence the autonomic nervous system?
    - text: "Your answer: No answer Correct answer: Activates sympathetic output Explanation: The amygdala increases sympathetic nervous activity during threat perception. More Info: When triggered by fear or stress, the amygdala communicates with brainstem centers to initiate rapid heart rate, respiration, and muscle readiness."
  - listitem:
    - strong: What is the primary role of the amygdala in the brain?
    - text: "Your answer: No answer Correct answer: Fear processing Explanation: The amygdala is key in fear detection and emotional memory. More Info: Located in the medial temporal lobe, the amygdala helps recognize emotional stimuli—especially fear—and initiate appropriate behavioral responses."
  - listitem:
    - strong: What happens to fear response if the amygdala is damaged?
    - text: "Your answer: No answer Correct answer: Reduced fear response Explanation: Bilateral amygdala damage results in impaired fear recognition. More Info: Patients with amygdala lesions often fail to recognize or react to threatening stimuli. This supports its role in emotional salience."
  - listitem:
    - strong: What type of memory is the amygdala most involved in?
    - text: "Your answer: No answer Correct answer: Emotional memory Explanation: The amygdala enhances encoding of emotional memories. More Info: Emotionally charged events are remembered more vividly due to amygdala-hippocampal interplay. This strengthens memory consolidation."
  - listitem:
    - strong: Which neurotransmitter modulates amygdala-driven fear responses?
    - text: "Your answer: No answer Correct answer: GABA Explanation: GABA inhibits overactivation of the amygdala. More Info: Inhibitory GABAergic interneurons modulate amygdala activity. Dysfunction in GABA signaling is linked to anxiety and panic disorders."
  - listitem:
    - strong: The amygdala is part of which larger brain system?
    - text: "Your answer: No answer Correct answer: Limbic system Explanation: The amygdala is a key component of the limbic system. More Info: The limbic system regulates emotion, memory, and motivation. The amygdala plays a central role in fear and aggression."
  - listitem:
    - strong: Which therapy specifically aims to regulate overactive amygdala responses in PTSD?
    - text: "Your answer: No answer Correct answer: EMDR Explanation: EMDR helps reprocess traumatic memories stored in the amygdala. More Info: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) integrates bilateral stimulation to dampen hyperactive emotional responses."
