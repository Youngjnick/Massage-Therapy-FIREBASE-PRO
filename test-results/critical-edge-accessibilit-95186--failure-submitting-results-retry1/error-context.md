    - strong: What is the origin of the external oblique muscle?
    - text: "Your answer: External surfaces of ribs 5–12 Correct answer: External surfaces of ribs 5–12 Explanation: The external oblique arises from ribs 5 to 12. More Info: The external oblique originates from the external surfaces of ribs 5–12 and inserts into the linea alba, iliac crest, and pubic tubercle. It helps with trunk rotation, lateral flexion, and abdominal compression. Clinical Application: Massage work on this area can ease tension from repetitive twisting or poor posture."
