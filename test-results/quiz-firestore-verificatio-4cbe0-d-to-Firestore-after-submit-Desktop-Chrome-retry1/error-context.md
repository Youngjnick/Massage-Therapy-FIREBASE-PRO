        - strong: Where does the internal oblique muscle originate?
        - text: "Your answer: Thoracolumbar fascia, iliac crest, and inguinal ligament Correct answer: Thoracolumbar fascia, iliac crest, and inguinal ligament Explanation: The internal oblique arises from fascia and bony landmarks of the lower torso. More Info: This muscle originates from the thoracolumbar fascia, iliac crest, and lateral half of the inguinal ligament. It contributes to trunk rotation and compression of abdominal contents. Clinical Application: In cases of lateral strain or scoliosis, internal oblique involvement may be targeted in therapy."
      - listitem:
        - strong: Where does the transverse abdominis muscle originate?
        - text: "Your answer: Internal surfaces of lower 6 ribs, iliac crest, thoracolumbar fascia, and inguinal ligament Correct answer: Internal surfaces of lower 6 ribs, iliac crest, thoracolumbar fascia, and inguinal ligament Explanation: It originates from ribs, fascia, and pelvis. More Info: The transverse abdominis arises from the internal surfaces of costal cartilages of ribs 7–12, thoracolumbar fascia, iliac crest, and lateral inguinal ligament. It’s key in abdominal wall stability and core strength. Clinical Application: Massage that encourages deep abdominal relaxation can improve coordination of the transverse abdominis for core support."
