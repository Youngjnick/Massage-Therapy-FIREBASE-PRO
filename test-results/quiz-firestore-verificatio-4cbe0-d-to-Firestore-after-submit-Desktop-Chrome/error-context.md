        - strong: Which abdominal muscle is the deepest layer of the lateral abdominal wall?
        - text: "Your answer: Transverse abdominis Correct answer: Transverse abdominis Explanation: The transverse abdominis lies deepest in the abdominal wall. More Info: It sits beneath the internal and external obliques and wraps around the torso like a corset, playing a key role in stabilization and respiration. Clinical Application: Massage therapy focusing on diaphragmatic breathing and abdominal release can benefit this deep core stabilizer."

        - strong: Where does the internal oblique muscle originate?
        - text: "Your answer: Thoracolumbar fascia, iliac crest, and inguinal ligament Correct answer: Thoracolumbar fascia, iliac crest, and inguinal ligament Explanation: The internal oblique arises from fascia and bony landmarks of the lower torso. More Info: This muscle originates from the thoracolumbar fascia, iliac crest, and lateral half of the inguinal ligament. It contributes to trunk rotation and compression of abdominal contents. Clinical Application: In cases of lateral strain or scoliosis, internal oblique involvement may be targeted in therapy."
