      - strong: Which nerve innervates the rectus abdominis muscle?
      - text: "Your answer: Intercostal nerves (T7–T11) and subcostal nerve (T12) Correct answer: Intercostal nerves (T7–T11) and subcostal nerve (T12) Explanation: The rectus abdominis is innervated by lower thoracic spinal nerves. More Info: Specifically, the intercostal nerves from T7 to T11 and the subcostal nerve (T12) innervate the rectus abdominis, allowing voluntary motor control during trunk flexion and compression of abdominal contents. Clinical Application: This is relevant when assessing abdominal wall weakness or post-surgical nerve impairment."
    - listitem:
      - strong: Which nerves innervate the transverse abdominis?
      - text: "Your answer: Thoracoabdominal nerves (T7–T11), subcostal nerve (T12), iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves (L1) Correct answer: Thoracoabdominal nerves (T7–T11), subcostal nerve (T12), iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves (L1) Explanation: It is innervated by both thoracic and upper lumbar nerves. More Info: The transverse abdominis receives motor innervation from thoracoabdominal nerves (T7–T11), subcostal nerve (T12), and iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves (L1), providing deep abdominal stability. Clinical Application: Core training or massage for back pain often focuses on this muscle’s role in spinal support."
