## Test Results (detailed)
- **Test Suites:** 29 passed, 2 skipped, 31 total
- **Tests:** 182 passed, 23 skipped, 205 total
- **Snapshots:** 3 passed, 3 total
- **Time:** ~2.6s
- **Test results written to:** `test-results/summary.json`

## Key Changes
- Refactored quiz answer option flow for accessibility and robust two-step select/submit.
- Modularized test helpers, cleaned up ESLint config, and resolved merge conflicts.
- Added and tested robust `BadgeModal` with image fallback and accessibility.
- Added Node-based test to ensure every badge in `badges.json` has a corresponding image file in `public/badges/`.
- Updated `badges.json` to use image-based IDs (`first_quiz`, `accuracy_100`), removed obsolete `b1`/`b2`.
- All badge modal, quiz, and badge image tests pass.

## Notable Test Coverage
- Badge modal: open/close, image fallback, alt text, keyboard navigation.
- Quiz answer flow: keyboard and mouse, accessibility, two-step logic.
- Metadata: badge image existence, badge metadata consistency.

## Next Steps
- Add new badges by matching `id` to image filename.
- Use the badge image existence test to catch missing images early.
- Continue to improve accessibility and test coverage as needed.

All tests are passing and badge system is robust. Ready to commit!
