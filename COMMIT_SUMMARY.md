# Commit Summary: Analytics, Badge Modal, and Test Robustness Refactor (2025-06-13)

## Key Changes
- Refactored `Analytics.tsx` to use Firestore `doc` and `onSnapshot` for robust, real-time user analytics updates.
- Updated all analytics tests to use static mocks for Firestore and Auth, including proper `doc` and `onSnapshot` mocks with `exists()` and `data()` methods.
- Fixed all TypeScript, ESLint, and Jest environment issues (TextEncoder/TextDecoder, global/globalThis, ts-expect-error usage).
- Cleaned up and modularized test helpers, and ensured all badge modal and quiz option flows are robust and accessible.
- All badge image and metadata consistency tests pass.

## Test Results (detailed)
- **Test Suites:** 30 passed, 2 skipped, 32 total
- **Tests:** 185 passed, 23 skipped, 208 total
- **Snapshots:** 3 passed, 3 total
- **Time:** ~2.4s

## Notable Details
- All analytics and badge modal tests now pass with real-time Firestore logic.
- No remaining lint or type errors in the codebase.
- All global and environment setup for Jest is now robust and standards-compliant.
- Console warnings about React `act(...)` are present but do not affect test pass/fail status.
