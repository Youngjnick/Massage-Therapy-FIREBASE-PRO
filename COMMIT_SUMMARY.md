+# Merge Skipped Questions Script
+
+This script merges all eligible questions from `skipped_questions.json` into their destination files, preserving all metadata. It also:
+- Creates a backup of each destination file in `src/data/backups/` before modifying it.
+- Prevents duplicate questions (by question text) in the destination file.
+- Logs actions and summarizes the merge in a `merge_report.txt` file in the `scripts/` directory.
+
+## Usage
+
+```sh
+node scripts/mergeSkippedQuestions.js
+```
+
+After running, check `merge_report.txt` for a summary and `src/data/backups/` for backups.

More Info: The rectus abdominis muscle originates from the pubic crest and pubic symphysis and inserts on the xiphoid process and costal cartilages of ribs 5–7. It plays a vital role in trunk flexion and intra-abdominal pressure regulation."
